    "## üå± Original Sustainability Report Text (sample for this demo):\n",
    "In 2024, GreenFuture Corp. made significant strides in reducing its environmental impact. The company decreased its carbon emissions by 22% compared to 2023 levels, primarily due to a shift to 100% renewable energy across all manufacturing sites. Water usage was reduced by 18% through improved recycling systems, and waste sent to landfills dropped by 30%. In addition, GreenFuture launched a circular product design initiative to minimize material waste and extend product lifecycles. Employee engagement in sustainability programs increased by 40%, driven by new education campaigns and incentives. Despite global supply chain disruptions, the company maintained its ethical sourcing practices and partnered with local communities to plant 10,000 trees across five countries."
