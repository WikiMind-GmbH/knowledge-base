# langchain-tutorial

The langchain tutorials act as a good introduction to concepts and techniques used when working with LLM models.
This repository is a condensed version of the langchain tutorials. 
Additionally, I created toy projects to get to know the concepts and workflow.
The notebooks are designed to run on google colab, while the projects linked were run locally on Windows WSL.
