# Workflows

WorkflowsÂ are systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined paths.
So basically workflows are process diagram aka flow charts where parts of the parts of the flow chart are executed by LLMs.

While workflows can be arbitrarily complex, it's best to begin by focusing on small, distinct workflows of different types that can later be composed into more complex systems.

1. Prompt Chaining
2. Routing
3. Parallelization
