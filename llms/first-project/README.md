# First Project UNO Manual Chatbot

We want to build a small demo chatbot for chatting with the famous UNO game manual to resolve any questions about what the real rules are!

First we build in a jupyter notebook and then with a streamlit app.

For the streamlit app install

```bash
pip install streamlit
```

In the `streamlit_app.py` file you can see how to setup a basic chat app for streamlit. Also there is a really good documentation [here](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/tutorials/chat-and-llm-apps/build-conversational-apps)

You can also Deploy it for free on the Streamlit Cloud -> Hit the Deploy Button.
